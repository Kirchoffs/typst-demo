The equation $Q = rho A v + C$ defines the glacial flow rate.

The flow rate of a glacier is defined by the following equation:
$ Q = rho A v + C $

The flow rate of a glacier is given by the following equation:
$ Q = rho A v + "time offset" $

Total displaced soil by glacial flow:
$ 7.32 beta + sum_(i=0)^nabla Q_i / 2 $

Total displaced soil by glacial flow:
$ 7.32 beta + sum_(i=0)^nabla (Q_i (a_i - epsilon)) / 2 $

$ v := vec(x_1, x_2, x_3) $
